## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Basic HTML and CSS

### What I learned

I learned about flexbox and its properties in order to have a responsive web page such as display: flex; , flex-wrap: wrap; etc.

Also, the button hover part is a new thing for me. I found it cool to use the transition-duration property to wait for a few seconds before the button changes its looks.


### Continued development

I will continue to learn to make modern and simple landing pages like this one. After finishing 3-4 projects, i will learn about javascript and other front-end frameworks. Then, maybe i will start going deep down to the back-end part of the website.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_button3) - I copied some of the base code for flexbox container from this website and then edited them the way i want my website to look.
